## About Me

I am currently a Postdoc at [Inria Lille-Nord Europe](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-luniversite-de-lille) within the Modal Team, where I work in the subject of inference problems on graphs. From 2017 to 2020, I did my PhD thesis at [Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/), under the supervision of [Yohann De Castro](https://ydecastro.github.io/). I obtained my bachelor's and engineering degree from [University of Chile](https://www.dim.uchile.cl/). 

My research insterest are **mathematical statistics** and **machine learning** -- more specifically my focus is on efficient algorithms for extracting information from network data and the theory of kernel methods. Lately, I have been working mostly on the graph matching and dynamic 
ranking problems.
