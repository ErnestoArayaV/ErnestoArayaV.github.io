## About Me

I am currently a Postdoc at the [Bavarian AI chair for Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-luniversite-de-lille), mentored by [Prof. Gitta Kutyniok](https://www.ai.math.uni-muenchen.de/members/professor/kutyniok/index.html). Before I was Postdoc at Inria-Lille, mentored by [Hemant Tyagi](https://hemant-tyagi.github.io/). From 2017 to 2020, I completed my PhD thesis at [Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/) under the supervision of [Yohann De Castro](https://ydecastro.github.io/). I obtained my bachelor's and engineering degree from the [University of Chile](https://www.dim.uchile.cl/).

My research interests encompass **mathematical statistics** and **machine learning**, with a specific focus on developing efficient algorithms for structured ML, inference on large networks and the theory of deep learning. Recently, I have been working on problems related to time series matching and mathematical foundations of spiking neural networks.
